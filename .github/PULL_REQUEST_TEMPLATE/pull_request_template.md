### TODO Before Asking for a Review
- [ ] Rebase your branch to the latest version of `dev` (or `main` for release PRs)
- [ ] Make sure all CI workflows are green
- [ ] When adding a public feature/fix: Update the `Unreleased` section of `CHANGELOG.md` (no date)
- [ ] Self-Review: Review "Files Changed" tab and fix any problems you find
- API Docs (only if there are changes in docstrings, rst files or samples):
  - [ ] Check the docs build **without** warning: see the log of the API Docs workflow
  - [ ] Check that your changes render well in HTML: download the API Docs artifact and open `index.html`
  - If there are any problems it is faster to iterate by [building locally the API Docs](../blob/dev/doc/README.md#build-the-documentation)
